<!-- 
1. How you attack this project is mostly up to you, but it is wise to begin by 
scaffolding out the structure of the page, and then tackle the various sections 
one by one. 

2. The area behind the “ODIN” logo is a div that has a dark, but semi-transparent 
background color. This enhances the readability of the text against the busy background 
image.

3. The color we’ve chosen for the ‘Create Account’ button is similar to tones found in 
the background image. Specifically, it is #596D48. 

4. The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E7EB), but we’ve included 2 
variations. For starters, the password inputs should be given an error class.

5. The other variation is the selected input, which should have a blue border and 
subtle box-shadow. This can be done with the :focus pseudo-class you’ve learned about 
in an earlier lesson.

6. Do not worry about making your project look nice on mobile, but DO resize your 
browser a little bit to make sure that it’s not completely broken at different desktop 
resolutions.

7. Checking that the password fields match each other requires javascript. Try to 
implement this if you feel confident, otherwise just validate each field separately.
